merge data with timesheet properly
    check if data visibility bug still exists
add an eraser
    maybe include right click as an eraser
allow for data to not overwrite (a toggle button, maybe a lock symbol)
    1. set activecells as the background instead of overlay, and only if there isnt a background already
    2. make changes to merge data so the timesheet cuts into activetime
    disable the eraser when this is on
add redux so info isnt passed exessivly
    handle mouse events via redux
    handle data input via redux
    split data from timesheet into individual days via redux
    maybe handle cell encoding via redux
highlight the current time cell by adding a class during render (if current day, if current time - current time + time interval)
animate the cells appearing
fix the toolbar
    make it appear at bottom of window, not as a sticky div
    general styling
add a sidebar that includes the day's task
add a history/popular tasks via the description input
    on clicking the description tasks appear above it
    typing in also doubles as a search function for existing tasks
    clicking adds the correct colour too
    maybe add a randomised data key? only if nessecary
add week and month views
    render 1 1440 cell per day, set up in a new component
add user login
