Change how the data is imported and displayed
    2 arrays needed, 1 for the times, and another for the tasks
    each task should contain a name, optional description, colour
    each time should contain the day, start, end, a reference to the task ID and notes
    the cell data should pull the times and reference the task to find the colour to display,
    later add a selection tool when clicked will display the time in more detail (i.e. the notes)

add redux so info isnt passed exessivly
    handle mouse events via redux
    handle data input via redux
    split data from timesheet into individual days via redux
    maybe handle cell encoding via redux

highlight the current time cell by adding a class during render (if current day, if current time - current time + time interval)
animate the cells appearing
fix the toolbar
    make it appear at bottom of window, not as a sticky div
    general styling
add a sidebar that includes the day's task
add a history/popular tasks via the description input
    on clicking the description tasks appear above it
    typing in also doubles as a search function for existing tasks
    clicking adds the correct colour too
    maybe add a randomised data key? only if nessecary
add week and month views
    render 1 1440 cell per day, set up in a new component
add user login
